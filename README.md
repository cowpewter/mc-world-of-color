# (for Minecraft Forge)
A Minecraft mod that adds 60 new colors of dye. These goal of this mod is for all dyes to be able to be used in all the normal ways that dye is used in Minecraft. 14 of the 16 default Minecraft colors now come in four additional shades (Lightest/Pastel/Dark/Darkest), in addition to the default vanilla shade. White and Black each come with two new shades, darker versions for White and lighter versions for Black.

This results in a total of 76 different dye colors!

# [Download DyeTastic Colors! from CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dyetastic-colors)

## Features (Current Version 0.0.1)

### Currently supported features:
* Two new items: Color Intensifier & Color Fader
* 60 new colorful dyes, which can be used with:
  * Concrete Powder (which also colors its associated Concrete)
  * Wool
  * Stained Glass & Stained Glass Panes
  * Terracotta (plain, not glazed)

### Caveats:
* Beacon colors are limited, so Stained Glass will color beacons their base color, but not a different shade. IE, Light Red Stained Glass and Dark Red Stained Glass both simply color beacons Red.
* Map colors are also limited, and so blocks dyed with the new colors will appear on maps as their base color. IE, Light Red Wool would render on a map as Red (So unfortunately, the new shades are not usable in Map Art)

### Up next:
* Dyed Clay Blocks/Brick

### Planned for Version 1.0.0:
* Beds
* Dye Sheep
* Banners
* Colored lantern glass
* Pet Collars
* Shulker Boxes
* Fireworks

### Planned for Version 2.0.0
* Stains - will color wood planks with an overlay
* Paint - will color wood planks with a solid color
* All the asstd things you could make with colored wood planks
* Stain/Paint wood fences/gates in addition to planks

### Future Features I'm Considering:
* Candles
* Glazed Terracotta - perhaps with brand new mosiac patterns, not just color adjustments
* Concrete slabs/stairs in all 76 colors
* Terracotta slabs/stairs in all 76 colors
* Sand/Sandstone (reg/cut/chiseled/slabs/stairs) in all 76 colors

### Not planning to support at this time:
* Leather Armor/any dying that uses two dyes to create a mixed color outside of the default 16 Minecraft colors
* Sign Text Color
